## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository comprises the following key components:

- **Datasets** (located in the `datasets` folder):
  - `games.csv`: Contains detailed records of chess games.
  - `worldchampions.csv`: Information on world chess champions.
  - `eco_codes.csv`: Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (ECO) codes.
  - `nations.csv`: Data linking players to their respective countries.
  - `GM_players_statistics.csv`: Statistics of Grandmaster-level players.

- **Script**:
  - `project.R`: R script for data analysis and visualization.

- **Supporting Files**:
  - `Edges.csv` and `Nodes.csv`: These files were used to create a complex node graph in **Gephi**, visualizing which countries had the most significant impact on world chess championships. The graph highlights the relationships between players and their respective countries, illustrating the dominance and influence of nations in the chess world.
